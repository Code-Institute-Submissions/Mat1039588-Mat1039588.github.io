                <p>In the guitar world Eddie Van Halen surely sits at the top amongst the greatest of all times. He was
                    born in Amsterdam in 1955 and he moved with his family in the United States in 1962. Him and his
                    brother, Alex, were both inclined to music. As teenagers Alex started playing drums and Eddie
                    started playing guitar. In the mid of the 70s the two brothers met David Lee Roth and Michael
                    Anthony and formed the Van Halen. During all the 80s the band was recognised as one of the most
                    famous rock band in the music industry, leading the band to produce several multi-platinum albums.
                    Due to some dispute inside the band, the Van Halen split several times during the years . They
                    reunited several times and they had different frontmen during these years: from David Lee Roth,
                    Sammy Hagar and Gary Cherone. Eddie passed away in October 6, 2020 due to cancer.
                    <br>
                    Eddie Van Halen has been worldwide recognised because of the innovation e brought into the guitar
                    world. The wide use of the term bar, high speed picking techniques, dive bomb sounds, and of course
                    the tapping technique, made of him of the pioneer and the ambassador of the heavy metal guitar.
                    Hugely influenced by Eric Clapton and the old school blues, Van Halen is the example of an
                    exaggeration of the blues, taken into its purity and destroyed it and then rebuild it in a more
                    aggressive way. The use of the vibrato technique with both is fretting hand and whammy bar(them bar)
                    gave him the aggressive playing we all know. He had the total control of his instrument. He could
                    easily cure the dynamics of the guitar with just his picking hand and using the volume knob of the
                    guitar. He reinvented blues classics and the tapping technique, pushing it to level never reached
                    before.
