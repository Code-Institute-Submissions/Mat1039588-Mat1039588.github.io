Code Institute - HTML, CSS project


This is my first website using HTML and CSS.

I wanted to create a website based on three of the most influential guitar players of the last 70 years.

The whole website is based on seven differen HTML docs.

1. index page (homepage)
2. page list
3. three musician dedicated pages
4. information about myself
5. contacts
6. a .css file 
7. readme file

I started with the homepage.

i created every single page first using Git and via the command <em>touch filename</em>, i created the 7 pages.
Before starting writing my code, I did some research about images to include in the project and background that would fit the purpose.

All the pages created have been updated as often as possible and put on the git platform using <em>git add</em>, <em>git commit -m</em> and <em> git push</em> via the terminal.

i have also constantly used the W3C validator for both the HTML files and CSS ones. 

The purpose of such a website was to give a quick overview to the users of three of the most important musicians ever lived but also my favourite ones. 

I have graduated in 2020 at the BIMM in London, a music college and been awarded with a Bachelor Degree in Popular Music Performance in Guitar. 

I wanted to use background images of the musicians I talked about to emphatise even more their importance.

I have use fonts taken from google.com, icons taken from fontawesome and applied all of them to every single pages.

The main page (homepage) contains a navigation section, where every single element had been linked to the related page. it has been made using the <em>anchor tag</em> and via the style.css document, the page got some more color and detail and nice effects.

I also used the <em>hero-btn</em> to create a button linked to the list page where i have used three different images, each one with the name of the artist and anchored them via the same tag to each one of their dedicated pages.

I made sure that every page presented the same style and the same layout.

I have encountered many problems whilst writing my code. But I do believe, most of the bugs encoutered, have been fixed.

the css part is very articulate, many sections have been included and a media query has also been added even though the final result on mobile devices could be definitely better.


All the pages have been tested using the W3C validator:
few bugs have been found nad fixed.

all of the pages created have been tested using LIGHTHOUSE on google.com and reached the same result, with just few score differences:

1. Performance: 90%
2. Acessibility: 80-05%
3. Best Practice 95%
4. SEO 90%
5. Overall score: 88-90%

there are definitely area where improvement is needed, but it is a functional responsive website.
