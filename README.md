Code Institute - HTML, CSS project


This is my first website using HTML and CSS.

I wanted to create a website based on three of the most influential guitar players of the last 70 years.

The whole website is based on seven differen HTML docs.

1. index page (homepage)
2. page list
3. three musician dedicated pages
4. information about myself
5. contacts
6. a .css file 
7. readme file

I started with the homepage.

i created every single page first using Git and via the command <em>touch filename</em>, i created the 7 pages.
Before starting writing my code, I did some research about images to include in the project and background that would fit the purpose.

All the pages created have been updated as often as possible and put on the git platform using <em>git add</em>, <em>git commit -m</em> and <em> git push</em> via the terminal.
