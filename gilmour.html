                <br>
                <p>David Gilmour, as a solo artist and as Pink Floydâ€™s guitar player, has brought the guitar and the
                    guitar sound into uncharted territories. It is to be considered one of the finest guitar player
                    ever. David Gilmour surely had been a huge influence for almost every guitar players from the late
                    70s till today. He is a British guitarist, born in Cambridge in 1946. Hes mostly known for had
                    stepped up into replacing Sod Barrett, member of the early Pink Floyd, together with Richard Wright,
                    Nick Mason and Roger Waters. Pink Floyd reached huge success partly due to Davidâ€™s skills as
                    composer, singer and guitar player. For more than 20 years, David Gilmourâ€™s attention to the
                    details, to the technology and the sound of his instrument, managed to come up with thousand of
                    guitar sound almost every guitar player tries to replicate. In 1994 they won a Grammy for Marooned,
                    a track in The Division Bell album. In 1996 Pink Floyd were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall Of
                    Fame (USA) and again in 2005 (UK). Since the band parted, David Gilmour kept working on his career
                    as solo artist. <br>
                    What makes David Gilmour standing out the multitude of guitar players, is the smooth and perfect
                    bends he perform on the guitar. His style is extremely characterised by the widely use of bends,
                    tree bar and a simple yet sophisticated phrasing. His phrasing comes from a blues music vocabulary.
                    He uses pentatonic most of times and sometimes he would go for arpeggios, major and for scales. The
                    use of these pretty basic scales in a wise manner, always create unique sounds and atmosphere. The
                    wise use of effects, gives him the possibility of creating almost any sounds possible.
