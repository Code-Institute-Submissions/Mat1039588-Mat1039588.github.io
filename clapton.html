                <p>Eric Clapton is with no doubt one of the most important guitar players ever lived. The British
                    guitarist is an acclaimed musician starting at a very young age in south London. He was born in
                    March 1945 in England. He has always been surrounded by music, since is grandmother was a pianist
                    and this gave Eric a good start in his musical career. It was at the beginning of the 60s that he
                    started playing the guitar more often and started becoming one of the most respected guitarist in
                    London. It was during the 1965 that Clapton joined the Bluesbrakers and John Mayall and they
                    recorded one of the most influential hard blues album, The BluesBrakers with Eric Clapton (also
                    known as the Beano Album). The international success and fame came after leaving the Bluesbrakers,
                    Clapton joined what later became one of the most influential rock band ever: Cream. With Ginger
                    Baker at the drums and Jack Bruce playing the bass guitar, the three young British boys influenced
                    with their sound generations and generations of musicians. The 70s have been a bit of a black hole
                    for Clapton. The wild misuse of drugs and alcohol, made him lose the path he was destined to pursue.
                    After more than 10 years, he managed to come back to life and take control of his life again. He
                    founded the Crossroads Centre, a drug and rehabilitation facility in the Caribbean islands. Eric
                    Clapton was ranked amongst the best guitar players of all time, inducted in the Rock an Roll Hall Of
                    Fame three times: with the yardbirds, with Cream and as a solo artist. Today he still does live in
                    south of England and keeps making music and regularly performing live. <br>
                    Eric Clapton is considered a master of the blues guitar, particularly of the Chicago blues. His
                    technique and sound make him immediately recognisable. Phrasing and feel with the instrument unique
                    and hard to replicate. Here are few peculiarities that makes Eric Clapton sounds like no other: As a
                    blues player, the minor pentatonic looks like the obvious choice for a guitar player or any blue
                    player. To give the song a more exotic sound, Clapton often uses the major pentatonic. The loud
                    amplifier. Having a cranked up amp will give you just what you need. Tube amps are the best choice
                    because of the tubes. Once properly warm, they will have tons and tons of warm and thick classic
                    overdrives tones. He just turn the amp volume all the way up. Know as “Slowhand”, Clapton became
                    famous for his phrasing. He never played just random notes or just for the sake of it. It is
                    important for him that the music serves the song. His extremely melodic phrasing makes him one of
                    those few able to creative guitar solos so well connected that fits in the song. People think about
                    him as a master in “composing a song inside a song”. His solos always have a beginning, a middle
                    part and an ending. Since the 70s he’s always been inclined to play Fender guitars. His signature
                    Fender Stratocaster has the peculiarity of having a mid boost circuit inside its body that allows
                    him to have a booster of mid frequencies whenever he needs and going back to the initial amount of
                    volume just turning a knob on his guitar. Blues music had always been an obsession for Clapton. He
                    became a master of the genre because he deeply studied and analysed the blues going back to its
                    roots and presenting it in a way, he would be easily recognisable by just listening to few notes and
                    sharing a music full of history, tradition, passion.
